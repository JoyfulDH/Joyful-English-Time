<h2>Parts of Speech</h2>
<p>There are 8 different types of words in English. They are <a href="https://youtu.be/fhEKfGG5-yk">Nouns, Pronouns, Prepositions, Conjuncts</a>
and <a href="https://youtu.be/fyB-faq0wFc">djectives, adverbs, verbs, interjections.</a>As It may sound difficult to differentiate them at first.
However as you frequently run into the examples and keep practicing telling them apart, you will get the idea in the ead. So <strong>Never give up</strong> and <u>just follow me.</u></p>
